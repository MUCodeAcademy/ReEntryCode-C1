# Creating a React App

Let's create our React App so you can get an idea of what we're going to be working with, then we'll dive deeper into the structure.

There are multiple different ways to build a React app. One that is very popular, and that we'll be using for this class, is called Vite:

`npm create vite@latest`

It will give you some prompts that will let you enter a project name and some other options.

Then, it will create a React application with some starter code, and put it into a folder with the name of whatever you called your project.

You will then have to go into the folder in the terminal with the 'cd' command:

`cd project-name`

Now you can the app with this command:

`npx vite`
