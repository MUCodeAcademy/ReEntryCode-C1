# The React Lifecycle

When a react component gets created (by the browser) and then re renders or changes, it follows a series of steps in order. This is the lifecycle. A diagram if it is as follows:

Basically the three steps:

Mount:
- Happens when the component is displayed on screen.

Update:
- Happens when a part of the component is updated. 

Dismount:
- Happens when the component is destroyed or put off screen.
