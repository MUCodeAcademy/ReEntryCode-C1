# Desktop Tools for SQL and PostGres

Being able to write queries is important but how do you write those queries when you need to connect to a database remotely? That's where desktop tools come into play. There are different tools depending on what SQL language you are using (MySQL, PostGres, etc.) and how much control you want over your database. We'll be looking at a couple different options you can use ranging from the most simplistic to ones that give you the most control. We'll also look at how to set up a local database for testing purposes. The resources below are not the only ones available they are simply some of the ones we will be using in this course.

## MAMP

MAMP allows you to create a simple MySQL server locally and interact with it via PhPMyAdmin. This is the most simplistic of tools but allows you to get an introduction to the world of database management. The fact that it allows for you to set up a local database quickly without much configuration needed allows you to test things out without having to learn a complex program.
