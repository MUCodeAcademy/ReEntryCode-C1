# Resume Tips

## General

- Most recent and relevant experience goes towards the top.
- Try to make it one page. It's fine if it's one and a half, as long as the content is relevant and important.

## Projects

- Ideally have between 3-5 projects that you can list on your resume. 
- Give a brief description of what you did and why it's impressive. Give a link to the website it's hosted on or the GitHub respository.
- Be prepared to talk about those projects during a job interview. They might ask what some of the most challenging aspects of the project was, what you did to overcome them, or some technical specifics of the project.

You're going to want to put projects on your resume that are somewhat impressive. This means that, unfortunately, things like the Todo App won't cut it. Generally, you're going to want to build something that include these:

- A Frontend
- A Backend with an API
- Database
- Documentation

Bonus: 
- Tracking user analytics

It should also be deployed to the internet (as well as GitHub) so that anyone can access and/or download it.

If you want some project ideas, check out [OtherProjects.md](../!ProjectList/OtherProjects.md) in the !ProjectList folder.

## Education

- List any education you received. You don't have to go into detail, but the name of the school, field of study, and the year(s) you attended should be there.
- Generally you don't need a degree even if it's listed in the job description, but if you have a degree, make sure to list it either at the top or bottom of the resume. If it's not a computer science related degree, it should go towards the bottom of your resume, unless you're a Harvard graduate or something.

## Certificates

- Certificates are always helpful. The certificates you get from this class should go in this category. If you have any others, list the title, date awarded, and the company/organization you received it from.
- These can go towards the bottom.

## Skills

- Usually, a list of skills is put towards the bottom. Here are some example skills from this class that you can put in your resume:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - Node
    - React
    - Jest
    - MySQL
    - WebSockets
    - Git
    - Problem Solving

## Examples

I have two versions of my resume that you can look at for examples. I will link the downloadable files here so you can download them and fill them out with your own information if you want. I also have them as .pngs in this folder in case you want to look at those.
