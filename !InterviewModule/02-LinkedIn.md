# LinkedIn Tips

## Profile

- "Headline" should describe key skills (e.g., "Full Stack Web Developer")
- "About" section should describe who you are, what you've done, and what you're passionate about.
- You can use the "Projects" section to showcase your projects and give links to the website/repository.
- You can also take skill tests for things like JavaScript, React, SQL, etc. These are not super important in my opinion, but it's not a bad idea. Usually, listing 5-10 skills is fine.
- For the most part, your profile will probably look similar to your resume, potentially just with more information.

## Networking

- Connect with me ðŸ˜Ž
- In my experience, most people in the industry (developers, recruiters, managers) will accept your requests. You can start by finding other developers/recruiters in the area (LinkedIn will probably automatically recommend these to you).
- You can join groups related to programming/technology to stay up-to-date on the most recent advancements.

## Jobs

- LinkedIn is a good place to look for jobs. I'd mainly search for jobs with these keywords:
    - Web developer
    - React
    - SQL
    - Testing/DevOps
- If you connect with a recruiter, reach out to them and see if they can help you get a job. You will probably have an easier time searching with them than on your own. I can also introduce you to recruiters if you'd like.
