# Stuff to Download

In order to make web apps like we do in class, here's a list of software you'll need to download at home:

- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    - There's a list of extensions I use in the VSCodeExtensions.md file
- Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download
- MAMP: https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads

If you want to make a React app, run this command in the terminal:

`npm create vite@latest`

Follow the instructions it gives you, and you're good to go!
