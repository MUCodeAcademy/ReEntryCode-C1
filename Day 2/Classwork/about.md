## Simple About Page

Using the about.jpg picture as a potential guide: 

![about.jpg](./about.jpg)

Create a simple web page with all the requisite styling. This page will act as a pseudo about page for you. Fill it in with any information you might want to (can be real or fake) and make it your own. Not shown in the image, the following style should also be applied:
* On hover, the links should change to an orange color.
* Visited links should change to a red color.
    - To do this, use the a:visited pseudo class
* When the image is hovered over, the rounded edges should disappear.

After the above is done, change the colors so that they match better. Also, utilize fonts and font-families for the text.

You can add a lot more information if you prefer but this should be the minimum.
