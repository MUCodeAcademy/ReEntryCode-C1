In programming/software engineering this principle is called red green refactor. 

Red: You write a naive test for what your code should do and it fails bc your code doesn’t do it yet

Green: you write code, any code so your code passes the test

Refactor: you refactor your test so it’s less naive and tests closer to the outcome you want. You can also refactor your code in this step.
