# Practice Instructions

## Step 1

- Work on flexBox.html to achieve the desired styling for each div.

## Step 2

- Utilizing the image file of the same name (flexPractice.jpg), build a site using flex to achieve the design in the image:
  ![flexPractice.JPG](flexPractice.JPG)
- The divs with numbers should be correct order in the HTML and you should use CSS to change their orders:
  Correct:
  ```html
  <div class="">1</div>
  <div class="">2</div>
  <div class="">3</div>
  <div class="">4</div>
  <div class="">5</div>
  <div class="">6</div>
  ```
  Incorrect:
  ```html
  <div class="">1</div>
  <div class="">6</div>
  <div class="">2</div>
  <div class="">5</div>
  <div class="">4</div>
  <div class="">3</div>
  ```
- There should be a minimum height for each div but there should be no maximum height. (min-height property)
- Once you are finished with the styling, add actual content of varying sizes to the divs to ensure they still flex appropriately. This can be done with filler text or with actual content of your choice.
- Use flexBox.html as a reference in order to achieve the desired effects.

## Step 3

- Using the tetris.jpg file as a starting point, create the same layout using flex box.
- Try first to get the horizontal layout correct and responsive to changes in browser width.

*Hint: Each box is its own div; using the box-sizing and box-shadow properties for each one would probably be a good method.
