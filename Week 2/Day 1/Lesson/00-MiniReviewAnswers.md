4. Give an example of how you would create a paragraph in HTML:

```

5. Now, put that paragraph inside a `div` in HTML:

```html
<div>
    <p>Paragraph text</p>
</div>
```

6. Now, add a class and an ID to that paragraph:

```html
<div>
    <p class="name" id="name2">Paragraph text</p>
</div>
```

7. Give an example of each of the three different ways that you could apply styling to that paragraph:

```css
#name2 {
    /* styling here */
}

.name {
    /* styling here */
}

p {
    /* styling here */
}
```

8. What's the benefit of using classes and IDs?

- Organizes elements together and lets you reuse styling

9. Give three examples of different CSS properties that you can use to style the paragraph:

- background-color
- margin
- font-style
