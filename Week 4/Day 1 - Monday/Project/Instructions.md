# General Instructions:

You will be building a two (or three, as a bonus) page website for a fictitious company.
Each page has a specific setup guide that should be followed. Each page description
has the _minimum_ that needs to be completed for each page. You can do more styling
or more media queries for each (and I recommend you do) if you have time. If you have an actual idea in mind as opposed to building a site with fake data, let me know, as it might be better for you to use this to build a site you might use.

## Guidelines:

- Try not to repeat your CSS properties. (think: "Can I reuse this and add it to a class?")
- You should have only one CSS file that you reuse on all three pages.
- Pick colors that you think work well together - they don't have to be perfect.
- Look at previous lessons and classwork if you don't remember how to use a certain HTML element or CSS property.
- Ask questions if you need help.
- Feel free to work with others.
- Keep in mind that the images shown are only shown as they would appear at the largest resolution.

# Page Instructions:

## All Pages:

All pages should have the same menu and footer styled as follows:

#### Menu:

- There needs to be three menu items with each one linking to the other two pages.
- The one for the page you're currently on should have a different color than the others and not link anywhere.
- Both of the non-current links should change color when you hover over them.

#### Footer:

- The Footer should have your company information (can be filler or made up) and include an image.
- Styling should be however you see fit, but there should be some space between the body content and the footer.

## To use the pictures

Since the pictures are all in a folder called 'Pictures', you will need to specify that they're in that folder like this:

<img src="Pictures/fish2.jpg" />
