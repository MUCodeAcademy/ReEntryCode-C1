## First Page

The first page will be your "Main Page" and can be named however you'd like for the links going to it.

This page should be separated into two distinct sections and should be styled as follows.

#### Main Section:

- The main section should take up the majority of the page.
- It should contain at least 10 sub sections displayed in rows.
- Regardless of number of subsections per row, all items on each row should have the same height and should scale together as needed.

#### Side Section:

- The side section should take up the remainder of the screen and be right next to the main section.
- It should contain at least 5 sub sections.

#### Both Sections:

- Use whatever filler text you prefer for all subsections.
- Each subsection should have a different amount of filler text to make sure their height scales regardless of content.
