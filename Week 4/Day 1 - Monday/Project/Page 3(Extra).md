## Third Page

The third page should be an "Items for Sale Page" (named however you prefer for the links). It should be broken up
into two distinct sections and styled as outlined below.

#### Side Menu:

- There should be a menu on either the right or left (your choice)
- The side menu should have 10 links in a column that correspond to the main items. If you click on one of those links, it should take you to the matching item in the main section (similar to the bear link on the Day 1 IntroToHtml.html lesson around line 46)

#### Main Section

- The remainder of the page should be taken up by items for sale with a small amount of whitespace between the main section and the menu.
- Each item should correspond to a link on the side menu.
- Each item should contain a picture and a description (use whatever filler you prefer but make them of varying lengths.)
- When a user hovers over a picture, it should increase in size.
- At the bottom of each item container should be a link to return you to the top of the side menu. (think: "Go To Item Menu")
