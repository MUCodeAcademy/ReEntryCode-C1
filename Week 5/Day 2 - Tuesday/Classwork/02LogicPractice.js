// Logic Practice

// 1. Positive or Negative
// Create a program that checks if a number stored in a variable is positive or negative. 
// Log "The number is positive" if it's greater than zero, otherwise log "The number is negative."

// 2. Minimum Age for Driving
// Write a program that stores a user's age in a variable, and logs "Can Drive" if they are 16 or older.
// If they are under 16, log "Cannot drive."

// 3. School Grade Levels
// Create a program that stores a student's grade in a variable and categorizes school levels based on that variable.
// Use the following categories: "Elementary" for grades 1-5, "Middle" for grades 6-8, and "High" for grades 9-12. 
// Log the school level according to their grade.

// 4. Basic Discount System
// A shop offers a discount for purchases over $50. 
// Write a program that stores the total purchase amount in a variable. 
// If the amount is over $50, calculate the discount and log it. Otherwise, log "No discount available."
