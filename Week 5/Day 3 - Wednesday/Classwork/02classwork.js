//! LOOP PRACTICE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
//! Take an input from the user. Starting with the 4th character,
//! log all characters until the end of the input.
//! If the input is shorter than 4 characters, nothing should be logged.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------
//! Pick a random number. Prompt the user to guess a number. If the number is correct,
//! end the loop and tell the user how many tries it took to guess.
//! If it is incorrect, continue the loop.
//! (Test functionality by logging the number that was randomly generated in the prompt).

// COMPARISON PRACTICE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
//! Build a simple site that prompts a user for their first name and then a number
//! between one and one-hundred (inclusive).
//!  - Tell them whether their number is odd or even and if its greater than,
//!    or less than/equal to 50 and then log those messages separately to the console.
//!  - Log every number from 0 to their number in a loop.
//!  - (example: if they enter 32 as a number, log each number from 0 to 32)
//!  - If their name is your name send an alert saying that it is a great name
//!  - Log their name in reverse to the console.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------
//! Take the following arrays: `[-1,-2,2,10,7,8]` and `[4,-2,2,7,9,5]`
//! and see how many items the two arrays share in common.
//! Do this without prototypical functions (ex. array.filter and array.includes).
//! Hint: use a nested loop

let array1 = [-1,-2,2,10,7,8];
let array2 = [4,-2,2,7,9,5]
