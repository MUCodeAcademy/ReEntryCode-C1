// Weather Dashboard
// Objective: Create a website where users can view the weather for their city.

// 1. Allow users to select a city from a dropdown menu.
// 2. Display weather information (e.g., cloudy, temperature, rainy) for the selected city

// Select all your options from the HTML and attach an event listener to each one
    // If the function runs immediately, in the event handler try:
    // () => weather("Omaha")

// Write a function that displays weather information depending on which city they clicked
