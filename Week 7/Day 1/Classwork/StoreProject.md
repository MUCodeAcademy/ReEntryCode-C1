# Store Project

We will be building a virtual store, similar to websites like Amazon or eBay.

There will be some things we can't do, such as letting people create accounts (that will come later) or letting them actually buy products, but we can build all of the other functionality for the site.

Here's what we'll need:

1. HTML
    - Create a div where you will put the product information (this will be empty for now; we'll insert the products with JavaScript)
    - A cart page, where the user can see what products they've added to their cart.
    - A checkout button on the cart page.
    - Maybe have a menu bar at the top to navigate to a 'home', 'products' and 'checkout' page.
2. JavaScript
    - Display the products on the page.
    - Display the total price of their items (add tax?).
    - When they click checkout, give them a confirmation that their order was received.
3. CSS
    - Make it look however you want, just put it in its own .css file.
