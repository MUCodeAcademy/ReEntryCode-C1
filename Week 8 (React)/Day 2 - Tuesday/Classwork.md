# Classwork

1. Create an array of 5 users and display them all to the page using the `map` function.
2. Create a component that generates a random number between 1-10 and displays it to the page. Have that component appear 5 times on the page. Do you think the number will be the same or not?
3. Add a conditionally rendered message to the component in step 2 that shows a message to the DOM if the number is odd or even. (i.e. `Number is even`). There are multiple ways to do it, but think about what might be the best approach.

4. Create a simple component that has a timer that counts down on the page.
5. Create a modal for a user that has their name, age, and a profile picture.
