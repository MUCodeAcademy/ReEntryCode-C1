# Brief React Overview

1. Why do you want to use state in React rather than regular variables?

- 

2. Create a state that holds a counter (number).

```jsx

```

3. Now increase that state's value by 1.

```jsx

```
5. Write a useEffect that logs the value of the counter to the console whenever 'counter' changes.

```jsx

```

6. If we have an input element, how would we store what the user is typing into this input?

```jsx

<input 

    />

```

5. What is context, and when would you want to use it?
