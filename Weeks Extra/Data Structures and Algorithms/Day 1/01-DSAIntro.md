# Data Structures and Algorithms

## What are Data Structures and Algorithms?

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that are crucial for solving complex problems efficiently. While data structures organize and store data, algorithms are the steps or procedures used to manipulate the data stored in these structures.

### Data Structures

A data structures are a way to store data, often allowing us to store massive amounts of information. Understanding these is key to building efficient and scalable algorithms.

We've already been using some data structures in our code, like arrays. Here are some common data structures:

- **Arrays and Lists**: Store data elements in a linear order.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Handle data elements in LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) manners respectively.
- **Trees and Graphs**: Non-linear data structures for storing hierarchical and networked data.
- **Hash Tables**: Store key-value pairs for efficient data retrieval.

### Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They can include simple processes like sorting and searching, or more complex ones like data compression and artificial intelligence algorithms.

We've used one algorithm a few times - the Fisher-Yates shuffle, which is a shuffling algorithm. Here are some classic algorithm types:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Sorts information in ascending or descending order. Bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.
- **Search Algorithms**: Used to locate items within a collection of data. Linear search, binary search.
- **Computational Algorithms**: Algorithms that deal with the calculation and processing of data.
- **Dynamic Programming / Recursion**: Techniques for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

We'll learn and use all of these data structures and algorithms eventually.

## Why Study Data Structures and Algorithms?

Algorithms are used by literally every tech company for a multitude of reasons. For example, Google uses an algorithm called PageRank which measures the importance of webpages to determine which order to display them in. YouTube, Netflix, and other similar services use recommendation algorithms to determine what content it should show you on the home page. There are algorithms for hashing data, AI learning, data analysis, and many more. Interacting with these algorithms will be common, and understanding the different types and structures are increasingly important.

More specifically, studying data structures and algorithms allows developers to:

- **Solve Problems Efficiently**: Understanding the right data structure or algorithm to use can significantly speed up a program.
- **Improve Space Efficiency**: Using appropriate data structures can reduce the space a program occupies in memory.
- **Enhance Problem-solving Skills**: It enhances your problem-solving skills and your ability to think critically and algorithmically.
- **Career Development**: Proficiency in data structures and algorithms is often an important component in technical job interviews.
