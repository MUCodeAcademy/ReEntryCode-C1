# Practice

Time to practice arrays, maps, bubble sort, and linear search.

Choose one project to start with.

1. To-Do list with arrays/maps
    - Create a to-do list that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks.
    - You can add a category to each task that allows people to sort by category.
    - You can add a priority level to each one, so that it sorts/processes them by priority.
2. Customer Support Ticket System
    - Create a ticket system where you can add new tickets to the queue, and process tickets in the order they were received.
3. Contact List
    - Create a contact list application where you can add, remove, and sort contacts by name using bubble sort.
4. Recipe Finder
    - Create a recipe finder application that uses an array/map to store recipes and implements a linear search to find recipes by name.
5. Library
    - Create a library system where you can add, edit, delete, and search for books.
